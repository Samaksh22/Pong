This was a simple project I had been working on. The idea was to create a simple Pong game. This game could further be used to train an AI model.

My original plan was to learn some RL and apply it on the game.

As of yet, I have been unable to render the text on the display. This is because, it requires linking another text rendering library for SDL.
